	<b>[What is it?]</b>

	Possess a random ped, or spawn a new host ped and take them over. Each time you spawn you will drop your warrants, make you invincible and give you weapons.

	Embody over 250 unique ped skins found in GTA V. 

	With a single key stroke you can tele-port into someone else away from danger [J], or  embody a new ped and make your getaway on foot [K]  

	Unexpected skins are fun, and causing mayhem as one ped, then possessing someone else to watch the chaos ensue safely in disguise.
